This project aims to obtain some basilar assembly code (with explaination) for
running the boot code on the first sector of the hard disk from the bios,
obtaining, substantially, a naive generical bootloader.

Linux users:
For linux based systems you need only to get nasm, make and qemu, then type:

make qemu-run

to have fun.

Windows users:
For Windows based system there are some more steps to do to achieve a
totally automatic compilation of the project.
On the first hand you'll need to install powershell, then configurate it to
run arbitrary files without signature (oh you, Windows), running the powershell
with administrator rights and typing

set-executionpolicy remotesigned.

Next, you need to download nasm and virtualbox, and set the relative binary
paths in Makefile.ps1 changing the values of $nasmPath and $virtualBoxPath.

Then, have some fun running Makefile.ps1.
